## Description:
This project presents a dataset comprising averaged world development indicators from 2015 to 2018, sourced from reputable institutions such as The World Bank, the World Happiness Report, and Transparency International. It includes essential variables ranging from GDP and life expectancy to corruption perceptions index (CPI). Additionally, the project features a Random Forest model integrated into an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript webpage, allowing users to input specific parameters and obtain corresponding values from the CPI column.

## Dataset Information:
